              "\"About TajirOur mission is to make the retail economy of Pakistan radically more efficient.Stores in Pakistan have been buying products in the same way for nearly a century. Why should 20 trucks deliver to the same store in a single day? Why do salespeople waste fuel to collect orders on scraps of paper? Why do store owners wait restlessly for someone to visit once a week to collect an order?Tajir is a radical break from the past. We offer an app where stores can buy everything they need, delivered reliably the next day. We drastically reduce the number of vehicles on the road with efficient, centralized delivery, so both store owners and manufacturers enjoy higher profits. With $150B of purchases made by retailers annually, even modest efficiency gains have an outsized economic impact.We are backed by Kleiner Perkins (early investors in Google, Amazon) and Y Combinator (early investors in Coinbase, Airbnb, Dropbox). Learn more about us on Forbes and Geo News.What You’ll Do Deliver features to delight our customers. We are constantly pushing the boundaries on user experience, and we need a team of talented engineers to lead the way.  Tame complexity. Tajir has built a complex, ever expanding suite of software with a very small team. We can only manage because of our investments in software quality through strong architecture, code reviews, test driven development, and developer tooling. We expect new hires to join us in writing elegant, maintainable code.  Optimize, optimize, optimize. We are obsessed with optimization. Every .01% of efficiency translates into millions saved in aggregate for our customers. Back end engineers at Tajir are involved with some of our trickiest problems: what is the best way to allocate work to order pickers? What is the ideal path for a vehicle to travel? How much inventory should we hold across our logistics network?What We Are Looking ForYou are humble. You treat others with the same kindness, patience, and respect, regardless of seniority, class, or gender. You are not deterred by tricky optimization problems. In fact, such problems invigorate you. You care deeply about writing beautiful code. You are tired of working on teams with spaghetti code. You are excited at the chance to meet our customers, to learn from them and help us decide what to build next. Requirements1+ years of full-time experience of professional software development (we seek all levels of experience, and will adjust our offer accordingly). Experience with SQL. Nice to haveYou have built something cool outside of university or professional life. You have made a substantial contribution to open source code. You have interviewed one of our customers in person (you'll find them in any market in Lahore). Our tech stackWe do not screen candidates by their experience with a specific tech stack. If you are a great engineer, you can adopt any new tools easily!That said, because everyone asks – our Android app is built with Java and Kotlin using an MVVM Clean architecture. Our back end is built with Python and Flask and deployed to Google Cloud as Docker images. We use PostgreSQL for transactional data, and BigQuery for analytical data.\\n        \\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show more\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            Show less\""
